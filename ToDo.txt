***** TO DO ******

	- implement player rage state 

- Slow down entire game when rage input is pressed, needs to be outside of the player state machine, count down the timer then change time scale back to normal
- Speed up player so they continue at normal speed when in rage mode(inside the rage state script), return everything to normal speeds once timer is complete
