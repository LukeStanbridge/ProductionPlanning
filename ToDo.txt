******Player Controller******

	- Hit with both fists(unsure if it will matter)
	- animation snap from running to walking during punch
	- force too much up close, limit somehow
	- player pops up off ground from ragdolls
	- make throwable objects ragdoll enemies

******Worry about when animations have been implemented*******

	- Spawn location and direction of particles
	- Audio variable for player/enemy movement, attacks, stun

*****Enemy Logic******

	- Little enemies - run and hide from player, die from 1 hit AOE or 1 hit punch
	- Big enemies - chase and attack player, causing them to stun(slow movement). Have to stun and hit to kill.
